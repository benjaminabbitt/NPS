## Conclusion

These 46 sites represent America's diverse heritage from Revolutionary War battlefields to pristine wilderness areas. **Successful passport stamp collection requires strategic planning**, particularly for seasonal operations affecting 32 of the 46 sites. **Massachusetts offers the highest concentration** with 16 sites concentrated in the Boston area, while **Montana provides the most challenging access** due to seasonal closures and remote locations. **Critical timing considerations** include Isle Royale's April-October season, Glacier's Going-to-the-Sun Road limited summer access, and multiple Mississippi sites sharing centralized stamp locations. **Civil rights sites in Mississippi demand cultural sensitivity**, while **wilderness areas in Michigan, Minnesota, and Montana require multi-day planning** for full experiences. The most efficient collection strategy involves **grouping geographically proximate sites** and **confirming seasonal operations** before travel, with **spring through early fall optimal** for accessing the majority of locations.
