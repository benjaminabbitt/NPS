# Claude Code Instructions
When processing abbreviations, ensure that the abbreviation is left intact.  Add the full text after the abbreviation.  e.g. NM should be expressed as NM (National Monument).

Do not attempt to exceed expectations.

Cite everything and preserve citations through edits/revisions.

Use Research Mode.

Search out activities and the time it takes to do primary activities at each listed site.

Search for any restrictions or idiocyncracies around getting cancellation stamps at that site.

Note key activities, time for those activities, and cancellation stamp restrictions.

Perform these instructions for all sites.  Do not select a subset.  This must be comprehensive.

Include the top 2-3 activities and any well recommended hidden gems unearthed from your comprehensive research.  Each activity needs timing data (time to complete)

Work through the first group completely, then the second, etc.  Do not skip any sites or defer any sites.

For all source citations, use markdown and generate a link
